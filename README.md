# Special Relativity Visualizer

## How It Works
What you are looking at is a moving "Spacetime Diagram".  It shows the velocity of objects through
spacetime.

Use the "Reference Frame" selector to choose what speed will be considered the "zero" speed.
The principle of relativity dictates that your choice of reference speed should *not* affect the
nature of physical laws; this diagram demonstrates that.  Notice that regardless of reference frame,
the speed of light remains constant.

You can also adjust the relative speeds of various observers to demonstrate various relativistic
effects.  Each line shows the path an object would take through space-time at the given velocity.
The dots on each line split them into regular intervals.  They may not look regular to you - close
to the speed of light, the dots appear to spread out significantly.  This is due to the odd geometry
of spacetime - in reality, the dots are all separated by the same "spacetime interval", which each
observer will experience as a single second along their time axis.  The dots therefore demonstrate
the effects of time dilation.
