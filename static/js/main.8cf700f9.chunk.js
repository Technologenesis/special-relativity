If you tried working out the distance between two points, you may have noticed that you're missing a very important part of the equation: ",Object(m.jsx)("i",{children:"c"}),", the conversion factor between meters and seconds!  I left this parameter at its real-world value, which is ~3x10",Object(m.jsx)("sup",{children:"8"})," meters per second.  As a result, ",Object(m.jsxs)("i",{children:["c",Object(m.jsx)("sup",{children:"2"}),"\u0394t",Object(m.jsx)("sup",{children:"2"})]}),"absolutely dominates the distance equation; ",Object(m.jsxs)("i",{children:["\u0394x",Object(m.jsx)("sup",{children:"2"})]})," is negligible in comparison. This incongruence gives rise to what appears to be a Galilean relationship between velocities. However, we can use ",Object(m.jsx)("i",{children:"light-seconds"})," for the units on our x axis.  A light-second is the distance light travels in a single second.  Since we are using the speed of light as our conversion factor ",Object(m.jsx)("i",{children:"c"}),", by definition, measuring our distance in light-seconds gives us a conversion factor",Object(m.jsx)("i",{children:"c"})," of 1 light-second per second:"]}),Object(m.jsx)(v,{allowPausing:!1,id:"pythagorean_spacetime",maxSpeed:3.14,step:.001,axisTicksX:10,showLightRays:!1,transform:function(e,t){return[[Object(j.d)(e)/t,-Object(j.i)(e)],[Object(j.i)(e),Object(j.d)(e)]]},translateVelocity:function(e,t,i){return t-e},observers:[{name:"Observer A",relative_velocity:0,proper_time:0},{name:"Observer B",relative_velocity:.3,proper_time:0},{name:"Observer C",relative_velocity:-.3,proper_time:0}]}),Object(m.jsxs)("p",{children:["Now ",Object(m.jsx)("i",{children:"there's"})," something interesting!
