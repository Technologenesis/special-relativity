With the benefit of hindsight, then, it seems\n                    that our approach to relativity should emphasize this fundamental symmetry, and that we should\n                    motivate our investigation in those terms.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    You're probably most familiar with symmetry in the realm of shapes, so we'll start there.  Take the\n                    example of an equilateral triangle.  We imagine that we are standing at one of its points; for\n                    brevity, we will call the point we are standing on <i>A</i>.  The point clockwise to us is <i>B</i>,\n                    and the point counter-clockwise to us is <i>C</i>.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Now, suppose that as you are contemplating the situation, I club you in the head, knocking you\n                    unconscious.  You wake up some time later and see that you are still on <i>some</i> point of the\n                    triangle. Ignoring the effects of any potential concussion, can you identify, just from looking at the\n                    triangle, which point you're standing on?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Assuming an ideal equilateral triangle, the answer is clearly no.  All the points look identical\n                    from the perspective of a person standing on any one of them - they would all describe the triangle\n                    the exact same way.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    This reveals the property that we call <b>symmetry</b>: informally, we will say it is the property\n                    that an object is identical from multiple perspectives.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Suppose now that I take you out to lunch as an apology.  During our meal, we notice a mysterious line\n                    drawn along the ground.  After sufficient assurance on my part that this isn't some kind of trick,\n                    we approach the line and investigate.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The line appears to go on forever in all directions.  We conclude that this line also has a sort of\n                    symmetry: we can follow the line in either direction, as far as we want, and the line will appear\n                    the same.  So we set down our things and follow the line as far as we can, for miles and miles,\n                    until finally, we come upon the place where we started.\n\n                    That we recognize this point means we must have been wrong about the symmetry this object possesses.\n                    I mean, yes, clearly it <i>is</i> symmetrical in some way - it looked identical to us at every step\n                    of our journey.  But you don't get back where you started just by walking along a straight line.\n                    It appears that what we thought was a line was actually just a very large circle, and that the\n                    symmetry we were observing wasn't the <i>translational</i> symmetry of a line, but the\n                    <i>rotational</i> symmetry of a circle.  We were right about the symmetry, but we were wrong\n                    about the <i>nature</i> of the symmetry - because the smallness of our perspective kept us from\n                    seeing what was really happening. Keep this example in the back of your mind.  We will be returning\n                    to it periodically.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Our universe, too, appears to be symmetric in many ways.  Taking the laws of physics together as a\n                    \"description\" of the universe, there are many ways in which a person can shift their perspective\n                    while that description remains valid.  For instance, I can carry out some closed experiment in\n                    America, and expect to get the same results in Spain - assuming nothing about the experiment has\n                    changed except the location.  So the universe, like the line, appears to exhibit\n                    <i>translational</i> symmetry.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Similarly, I can carry out an experiment, then face some other direction and carry it out again,\n                    and still expect the same results.  So the universe appears to  exhibit <i>rotational</i> symmetry.\n                    I can wait an hour and do the experiment <i>again</i> and still expect the same result - so the\n                    universe exhibits symmetry across <i>time</i>.  And finally - most relevantly for us - I can carry\n                    out an experiment at some constant speed, and then carry it out at <i>another</i> constant speed,\n                    and still get the same results.  The universe thus appears to exhibit symmetry across changes in\n                    velocity.  In all these cases, my description of the universe <i>itself</i> - the laws of physics\n                    that govern my experiment - remains identical.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    However, just as when we saw the line along the ground, we might ask ourselves what limitations the\n                    smallness of our perspective might be placing on our understanding of the nature of these\n                    symmetries.  This is the question we will reckon with here.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    We will continue to be very preoccupied with the symmetries of space and time, so I will leave the\n                    subject alone for now.  In the meantime, let's fix our gaze on the objects which supposedly exhibit\n                    all this symmetry: space and time themselves.\n                </p>\n\n                <Collapsible trigger={(<h3>Symmetry: A Mathematical treatment</h3>)}>\n                    <p>\n                        The ultimate goal of this site is to motivate relativity <i>intuitively</i>, without requiring a\n                        math background and accommodating a certain level of arithmephobia.  However, I want to offer the\n                        reader the opportunity to dive into the math if they so choose.  These sections aren't strictly\n                        necessary to digest the argument being made, but learning the math can help ground the information\n                        more solidly and thus give the reader better footing on which to reason.  The reader is thus\n                        encouraged to at least try wading through the math - without worrying about moving on if it's\n                        difficult to process.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        This section isn't full of <i>equations</i>, per se, but it nonetheless contains some\n                        mathematical reasoning leading up to a formal definition.  It's not strictly necessary; the\n                        intuitive notion of symmetry is enough to digest what comes from here on out, but we will give it a\n                        bit of a deeper treatment so that where intuition breaks down, the math will be here to ground us.\n                        So with that, let's introduce the mathematical discipline concerned with symmetry: <b>group\n                        theory</b>.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Group theory describes the ways in which a thing can be symmetrical.  Recall our informal definition\n                        of symmetry: it is the property that a thing can be described the same way from multiple\n                        perspectives. In these terms, then, group theory is about how these perspectives are related to each\n                        other.  That probably sounds pretty abstract.  Let's go back to an example - but you're not going to\n                        like where it is.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        For instance, the triangle we had our little incident on earlier is a - hey, come back!  I'll keep\n                        my hands in plain sight.  This triangle is a symmetric object, so its symmetry can can be\n                        represented in group theory. We'll introduce the <b>group</b> representing the triangle's symmetries\n                        by describing that symmetry ourselves.  Let's take a walk...\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We walk around the whole triangle, counting the points as we go.  This time, to stress the sameness\n                        of each perspective, we won't even bother to name the points.  The first thing we do is walk\n                        clockwise to the adjacent point.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        As before, we note that this triangle still looks exactly the same.  I mean, we <i>know</i> we\n                        didn't start here, but we wouldn't be able to tell just by looking.  Therefore, we've found some\n                        new perspective under which our object is completely identical.  And since it's identical, we should\n                        be able to do the same thing again and get the exact same result.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        So we continue our walk, clockwise again, to the next point, and find that we have <i>again</i>\n                        found a brand new perspective from which the triangle is identical.  We then continue, clockwise\n                        once more, and we do indeed find a perspective from which the triangle is identical - but this time,\n                        it's one we've already seen.  It's the point we started on in the first place.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        So we have three symmetric perspectives, all related to each other by a single action: the act of\n                        walking clockwise along the triangle's sides.  From any point on the triangle, we can get to any\n                        other point by repeatedly applying this action.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Given this, let's think about how we might talk about the different points of the triangle.  We\n                        already agreed not to give them static names; after all, if we ever forget which one's which, then\n                        the names are useless.  Much more relevant to us, as individuals who are only ever inhabiting one of\n                        these points, is to describe the points in terms of how we can get to each one.  We can then name the\n                        points as follows: the point we are standing on we will call <i>e</i>; this is a special point in\n                        our naming system, since we don't need to do anything to get there.  From here we can apply\n                        our action - walking clockwise - arbitrarily many times.  We will call a single application of this\n                        action <i>r</i>, two applications <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, three applications <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>,\n                        and so on.  So, the point immediately clockwise to us we will call <i>r</i>, since it takes us only\n                        one walk to get there; the point counterclockwise to us will be called <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, since\n                        it takes two clockwise walks to get there.  We could speak of <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>,\n                        <i>r<sup>4</sup></i>, and on down the line, but there's no need: we already have a name for these,\n                        since three applications of <i>r</i> gets us right back where we started.  In other words,\n                        <i>r<sup>3</sup> = e</i>.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We have now boiled down the symmetry of the triangle to its <i>most basic</i> elements: there is\n                        something we can do to it that leaves it looking identical, and if we do that thing three times, we\n                        get back where we started.  These are the defining properties of <i>C<sub>3</sub></i>, a\n                        mathematical object called a <i>group</i> which describes three-fold rotational symmetry - the\n                        symmetry of our triangle. At last, we are ready to look at a formal definition:\n                    </p>\n                    <Latex displayMode={true}>$$ C_3 = \\langle r | r^3 = e \\rangle $$</Latex>\n                    <p>\n                        We can read this is follows: <i>C<sub>3</sub></i> is the group consisting of repeated applications\n                        of the action <i>r</i>, such that <i>r<sup>3</sup> = e</i>.  <i>C<sub>3</sub></i> is short for the\n                        <b>cyclic group</b> of order three - the <b>order</b> being the number of distinct elements in the\n                        group.  The symmetry group of a rotatable square, similarly, would be <i>C<sub>4</sub></i> - the\n                        cyclic group of order 4.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        In general, a group consists, for one part, of all the <i>actions</i> that can be done to an object\n                        which leave it looking identical.  It also consists of an operation known as composition, &bull;,\n                        corresponding to the act of doing one action after the other.  Composing any two actions must always\n                        be a valid action; after all, if the first action leaves the object unchanged, then why would the\n                        second action no longer be valid?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Further, among its valid actions, the group must contain some <i>identity element</i>, <i>e</i>,\n                        which represents taking <i>no</i> action.  Composing any action <i>a</i> with the identity action is the\n                        same as just doing <i>a</i>.  Every action must also be invertible - for every action\n                        <i>a</i> there must be another action <i>a<sup>-1</sup></i> that is its <i>inverse</i>, so that\n                        <i>a &bull; a<sup>-1</sup> = e</i>; that is, doing one action and then its inverse is the same as\n                        doing nothing.  After all, if we can walk clockwise around the triangle, can't we then walk\n                        <i>counter-</i>clockwise and end up where we started?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The final property of these actions is a bit more subtle.  Take 3 actions, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>\n                        and <i>c</i>.  Now, surely doing a followed by b and c is the same as doing a and b, followed by c?\n                        Or, formally, <i>a &bull; (b &bull; c) = (a &bull; b) &bull; c</i>.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        With that, we have the definition of a <b>group</b>: it is a set <i>G</i> of \"actions\" on which is\n                        defined a composition operator &bull; which has the following four properties:\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <b>closure</b>: the operation &bull; is <i>closed</i> over <i>G</i>.  This means that for\n                                any two elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of <i>G</i>, their composition\n                                <i>a &bull; b</i> is also in <i>G</i>.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <b>identity</b>: there exists an <i>identity element</i>, e, which is the <i>do-nothing\n                                action</i>.  For any element <i>a</i> in the set <i>G</i>,\n                                <i>e &bull; a = a &bull; e = a</i>.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <b>invertibility</b>: for any element <i>a</i>, there is an <i>inverse</i> element\n                                <i>a<sup>-1</sup></i> such that\n                                <i>a &bull; a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup> &bull; a = e</i>.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <b>associativity</b>: for any elements <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>,\n                                <i>a &bull; (b &bull; c) = (a &bull; b) &bull; c</i>.\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Since the universe also has symmetry, there should be a way to describe this symmetry in\n                        group theoretic terms.  Take, for example, the universe's translational symmetry: the property\n                        that it's identical no matter <i>where</i> we view it from.  But this is a little different:\n                        our triangle had a finite number of symmetric perspectives, while the universe appears to have\n                        an infinite number.  Let's think about how to represent such a group; we will begin with the\n                        translational symmetry of a simple 1-dimensional line, and expand this definition to the three\n                        dimensions of the universe.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Recall the two parts that form a group definition: a set <i>G</i> of possible actions, and an\n                        operator &bull; representing composition.  Let's start with <i>G</i>: we want a set of all possible\n                        actions.  How many ways are there to slide a line along itself?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Well, let's say I break the line up into units.  I can slide it one meter forwards, or one meter\n                        backwards.  I can also slide it two meters forwards, or two meters backwards.  Or two and a half\n                        meters forward, or &pi; meters backwards.  Clearly, I can slide the line any distance I want; so\n                        the set <i>G</i> consists of an action for every possible distance I could slide the line.  We can\n                        represent this simply by allowing <i>G</i> to be the set of real numbers &#x211D;.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        If we were to do more than one of these actions in a row, we would see that moving the line\n                        by <i>a</i> followed by <i>b</i> leaves the line as if we had simply moved it by <i>a+b</i>.  So the\n                        operator representing composition, for us, is simply the addition operator +.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We can now define our group in different notation than the above group: we will say it is the\n                        set of real numbers paired with addition:\n                    </p>\n                    <Latex displayMode={true}>$$(\\reals, +)$$</Latex>\n                    <p>\n                        We can see that this definition satisfies our group requirements.  Addition is closed over the\n                        real numbers: the sum of two real numbers is always another real number.  There is an identity\n                        element, 0, corresponding to not moving along the line at all.  Every element also has an inverse:\n                        every real number has a <i>negative</i> with which it adds to zero, corresponding to moving the\n                        line and then moving it right back to where it was, which is the same as doing nothing.  Finally,\n                        addition is associative: <i>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</i>.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The 3D symmetry of the universe can be expressed similarly.  The only difference is that we can\n                        translate as much as we want in <i>any direction</i>.  We can express this as a combination of\n                        shifts in all three dimensions.  So rather than operating over the set of real numbers &#x211D;, we\n                        are operating over all <b>tuples</b> (or ordered sets) of 3 real numbers, where each number in the\n                        tuple corresponds to translation in one of our three dimensions:\n                    </p>\n                    <Latex displayMode={true}>$$(\\reals^3, +)$$</Latex>\n                    <p>\n                        We will think more deeply about some of the universe's other symmetries later.  For now,\n                        a brief parting word to the wise: note that the definition of a group does not\n                        include <b>commutativity</b>.  Commutativity is the property that for two elements of our\n                        set <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <i>a &bull; b = b &bull; a</i>.  This happens to have been the case for\n                        every group we've defined so far, so I want to make clear that this by no means needs to be true.

We have an axis for time which is totally\n                separate from our axis in space.  An object \"moves\" when its position in space changes based on its\n                position in time.  Furthermore, all objects experience time at the same \"rate\" - that is, a second is a\n                second is a second, no matter what velocity you're going.

In reality, these objects would be moving along the x axis at their\n                given velocity, but we will (usually) ignore this fact for the purpose of keeping all our objects neatly\n                within view, since it is not usually the positions we care about, but the velocities.</p>\n\n                <p>This simple diagram already puts us in a position to think about some of the things we'll be dealing\n                with as we explore relativity.  For instance, plotting space and time together calls into\n                question: just what is the stuff in the middle?  What is it that objects are \"traversing\" as time\n                passes?  And if we consider it as just one object, are distances in space and distances in time\n                unrelated?  These are the questions we will answer when we begin to discuss the geometry underlying the\n                universe itself - <b>spacetime</b>.</p>\n\n                <p>But let's not get too ahead of ourselves.  Now that we know what we'll be looking at, let's dive in\n                and see what the relativity scene looks like pre-Einstein.</p>\n\n                <h2>Galilean Relativity</h2>\n\n                <p>Although the word \"relativity\" is closely associated with Einstein's work, the concept predates him\n                by centuries.  Before Einstein, the word was most closely related to <b>Galileo's principle of\n                relativity</b>, which states that the laws of physics should apply equally regardless of <b>inertial\n                reference frame</b>. In other words, a person cruising along in a spaceship moving at a constant speed\n                follows the same physical laws as a stationary person.  Indeed, it should not be necessary, <i>nor even\n                possible</i>, for either of them to know which of them is moving.  Hence, Galileo asserts the existence\n                of a universal <i>symmetry</i> - the symmetry over velocity.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This sounds like a very simple principle, but it poses a couple of challenges for anyone tasked with\n                    transcribing the physical laws of the universe, which must be solved in order.  The more obvious\n                    is the <i>second</i> question: how do we write the laws in such a way that that they are\n                    <b>invariant</b> over the given symmetry - meaning observers in two symmetric perspectives wouldn't\n                    see a difference in the laws?  If our laws are to accurately describe the universe, they must be\n                    symmetric in exactly the same way the universe is.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    However, this is only relevant after a first question is answered - a much more subtle question with a\n                    seemingly intuitive answer.  That question is: <i>what kind of symmetry are we dealing with?</i>\n                    After all, if your laws are supposed to be invariant under some symmetry, you had better know what\n                    that symmetry is.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Note, though, the situation we find ourselves in when we try to answer this question.  Just as when\n                    we stood over what we thought was a straight line drawn on the ground, it could be that we are\n                    not seeing some bigger picture.  But we will form a tentative model for now.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Take a person, Alice, who is riding a train.  Ahead of her, through the window,\n                    she sees Bob by the tracks.  He is standing still on the ground, but relative to Alice, he is moving\n                    towards her at -9 meters per second. Alice throws an apple at 12 meters per second, relative to her,\n                    towards Bob's head.  Assuming that all motion is happening in the same direction, how do we know how\n                    quickly the apple will hit Bob's head?  In other words, how fast is the apple moving from Bob's\n                    <i>perspective</i>?\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Here's the same scenario in spacetime diagram form:</p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram showControls={false} showFrameSelector={false} showTimeOnAxis={true} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={50} spaceUnits={\"meters\"} axisTicksX={80} c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Alice\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Bob\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: -9\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Apple\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 12\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                We have no a priori way of converting this scenario to Bob's perspective.  However, we can do\n                experiments to try to figure out the relationships between these perspectives.  Say\n                we set up some speed detector next to Bob and carry out the experiment again to see what happens.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                The experiment doesn't reproduce perfectly - Bob is much angrier this time - but it works well enough\n                for us, and you know that if you say anything, you could end up on the wrong side of one of these\n                experiments again.

In other words, velocities seem to\n                    <i>add</i>!  We can incorporate this into our model of spacetime: we now know that the\n                    universe is symmetric under velocity addition, so we can build in the ability to add\n                    velocities in order to switch between reference frames:\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram showControls={false} showFrameSelector={true} showTimeOnAxis={true} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={50} spaceUnits={\"meters\"} axisTicksX={80} c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Alice\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 9\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Bob\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Apple\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 21\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                    This method of switching between inertial reference frames is called a\n                    <b>Galilean transformation</b>, and they form part of the foundation of Newtonian mechanics.  It is\n                    therefore asserted that the universe is <i>symmetric</i> under Galilean transformations.\n                    However, if you look closely, you will see that our \"straight-line\" example was more on the nose\n                    than you may have thought.  Observe how each dot simply slides to the side in a straight line when\n                    your perspective changes.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    This corresponds to a universal flow of time - one second in one object's perspective is the same\n                    as one second in everyone else's.  This seems like an extremely natural result of the universe's\n                    symmetry - why should time move faster in one perspective than the other?  After all, the universe\n                    is supposed to remain symmetric no matter your velocity.  And indeed, this was treated as a natural,\n                    fundamental property of the universe for a long time.  But we should beware that the smallness\n                    of our perspective doesn't lead us to accept unsure conclusions as forgone...\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    By Einstein's time there were some alarming discoveries in physics that seemed to threaten the very\n                    symmetry of the universe itself: the laws of physics appeared to actually <i>change</i> based on inertial reference frame.\n                    It appeared that for all the progress we had made in physics, something was wrong on the very\n                    fundamental level.  If we wanted a universe that was symmetric over changes in velocity, we were\n                    going to need a paradigm shift - as it turned out, one that revolutionized our understanding of\n                    the structure of space and time.\n                </p>\n\n                <Collapsible trigger={(<h3>Galilean Transformations: A Mathematical Treatment</h3>)}>\n                    <p>\n                        Here I will take a brief mathematical detour to describe these transformations more precisely; feel free\n                        to skip to the next section if you're not comfortable with some simple math.

We have this thing called a <b>Galilean\n                        transformation</b> that we can supposedly do to our universe and leave it looking the same, as\n                        far as the laws of physics are concerned.  So let's start by talking about what those\n                        transformations are.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        At their core, Galilean transformations are meant to describe how to convert between two\n                        coordinate systems (or <b>reference frames</b> which are moving relative to each other.

It's worth noting\n                    that this by no means needs to be the case.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Recall that our spacetime diagram portrays an object's motion through space over time - or,\n                    considered together, <b>spacetime</b>.  In our model, all objects flow through time at the same\n                    rate.  This is actually kind of an interesting property.  Our velocity through all spatial\n                    dimensions can be changed, but we have one, immutable velocity through time.\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram showFrameSelector={false} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={10} spaceUnits=\"meters\" c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Moving Body\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                Notice that no matter how you adjust the object's relative speed, the dots on its line - its flow of\n                time - always adhere perfectly to the straight horizontal lines running across our time axis.\n                This makes intuitive sense - it preserves a universal flow of time.  But if we think of our diagram in\n                terms of the stuff in the middle - <b>spacetime</b> - and think of the distance the dots are travelling\n                through it, we notice a strange property.  For fast bodies, the \"dots\" appear to move very quickly\n                along the line - that is, they appear to <i>speed up</i> through spacetime.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                And yet, when we switch into that object's frame of reference, its dots are spread out only by the\n                length of one second along the time axis, while it is the dots along our initial axis that are spread\n                out.\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram paused={false} showControls={false} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={10} spaceUnits=\"meters\" c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Initial Reference Frame\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Fast Body\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 10\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                    Let's think about this from the perspective of symmetry.  If the universe is supposed to be symmetric\n                    under this transformation, surely we can't be inflating some distances and compressing others?\n                    Surely both observers should agree on the distance they're travelling through spacetime?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Because of this, we must accept that the difference in distance is not <i>real</i>; the perceived\n                    difference arises only from our <i>perspective</i>.  In reality, therefore, distance through\n                    <i>spacetime</i> must not actually depend on distance through <i>space</i> at all!  This probably\n                    seems like a bit of a weird property, and in fact it is.  But it didn't seem all that weird before\n                    folks started thinking of space and time as intertwined, so we're kind of cheating.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                We will call this notion of distance through spacetime the <b>spacetime interval</b>.  The spacetime interval between two\n                points in spacetime will be the amount of time a body travelling between them would experience\n                during its journey.  So the fact that all the dots line up with the time axis - that\n                distance through spacetime depends only on distance through time - ensures that all moving bodies\n                experience time at the same rate, regardless of their speed.\n                </p>\n                <SpacetimeDiagram paused={false} showControls={true} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={10} spaceUnits=\"meters\" c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"A\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"B\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 1.5\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"C\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 3\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"D\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: -2\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n                <p>\n                    As a little thought experiment, let's think about what would happen if this <i>weren't</i> the case.\n                    What if, for example, distance through <i>spacetime</i> worked the same way as distance through\n                    regular <i>space</i>?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    In regular space, moving 3 meters forward puts you exactly 3 meters from where you started; but moving\n                    3 meters left <i>and</i> 3 meters forward puts you farther away than that; something like\n                    4.25 meters from where you started.

We have now decoupled ourselves from Galilean transformations, and are free to explore\n                    any spacetime we please!  Like this one!  This exotic spacetime geometry works by... well...\n                    actually, it doesn't seem to work all that differently, does it?  Why are our dots still so evenly\n                    spaced out along the time axis?  Shouldn't it be the length along the <i>line</i> which is\n                    constant?  Take a minute and try to think about why this might be.  We have seen a problem like this\n                    before.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Got it yet?  It's okay if not.  Generations of scientists took centuries to solve this problem.  I\n                    only gave you a paragraph break.  But you did get the benefit of some priming: recall the line we\n                    saw on the ground.  Now, at last, that metaphor pays off.  The dots on the line <i>appear</i> to\n                    be moving in a straight line, but this only <i>appears</i> to be the case because our perspective\n                    is so small.  We are looking at a diagram plotting meters against seconds, but we have no idea how\n                    much a single meter along our spatial axis will offset our speed through time.  As it turns out, in\n                    real life, a meter is actually an extremely small unit of measurement compared to a second, which is\n                    why our dots' positions in time don't appear to change based on changes in distance.  But are they\n                    <i>really</i> moving in straight lines?  Or, just as when we tried following the line on the ground,\n                    is this just an appearance arising from our limited perspective?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To answer this question, let's zoom out.\n                </p>\n                <SpacetimeDiagram allowPausing={false} id=\"pythagorean_spacetime\" maxSpeed={3.14} step={.001} axisTicksX={10} showLightRays={false} transform={(theta, c) => {\n                    return [\n                        [cos(theta)/c, -sin(theta)],\n                        [sin(theta),  cos(theta)]\n                    ]\n                }} translateVelocity={(v_frame, v_body, _) => v_body-v_frame} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer A\",\n                        relative_velocity: 0,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer B\",\n                        relative_velocity: .3,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer C\",\n                        relative_velocity: -.3,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n                <p>\n                    Now <i>there's</i> something interesting!  We've broadened our perspective significantly; the x axis\n                    is now measured in light-seconds, which is about 3x10<sup>8</sup> meters.  Fiddle around with the\n                    velocities a bit.  You'll find that increasing the velocity of an object <i>rotates</i> its time\n                    axis rather than <i>sheering</i> it.  The dot moves not along a straight line, but around the origin\n                    - in a circle!  Velocity here represents not the straight-line distance between the objects at each\n                    time, but the arc-length between the objects - i.e. the distance <i>along</i> the\n                    circle around which they are rotating.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Already we are uncovering some effects that have analogues in the theory of relativity.  For\n                    instance, because the dots are no longer evenly spaced along our reference frame's time axis,\n                    it appears to pass at different rates for different objects.  In our case, the dots appear closer\n                    together and thus <i>contracted</i>; their real-life counterparts appear <i>dilated</i> for very\n                    similar reasons.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Notice that if you crank the velocity, the line disappears below the x axis and pops up\n                    on the other side!  This is the <i>flip-side</i> of the line; it represents the object's past. By doing\n                    this, we have reversed the object's orientation along our time axis.  In other words, the object is\n                    travelling backwards in time!\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    This is a neat little property, but don't get too excited.  We've called an axis on our graph\n                    \"time\", but what's <b>time-like</b> about it, really?  It doesn't flow in a uniform direction.\n                    It's not related to the spatial dimensions in a special way: in fact, it's explicitly defined\n                    so that it fits in exactly with the other spatial dimensions.  An object in this universe could\n                    double back on itself and intersect with its own past - clearly a nonsensical property.  But this\n                    is nonetheless a good thought experiment with which to introduce <b>spacetime</b> and <b>spacetime\n                    intervals</b>.  We will see shortly that real spacetime has its own exotic properties which,\n                    luckily for us, nonetheless preserve the causal structure of time.\n                </p>\n                <Collapsible trigger={(<h3>Spacetime Intervals: A Mathematical treatment</h3>)}>\n                    <Latex displayMode={true}>{'$\\\\Delta s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^2+\\\\Delta y^2+\\\\Delta z^2}$'}</Latex>\n                    <p>\n                        To describe distance through space<i>time</i>, we could easily slip time into this equation:\n                    </p>\n                    <Latex displayMode={true}>{'$\\\\Delta s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^2+\\\\Delta y^2+\\\\Delta z^2+c^2\\\\Delta t^2}$'}</Latex>\n                    <Latex>\n                        Where $$c$$ is an arbitrary constant for converting between units of time and units of space.

If you tried working out the distance between two points,\n                        you may have noticed that you're missing a very important part of the equation: <i>c</i>, the\n                        conversion factor between meters and seconds!  I left this parameter at its real-world value, which\n                        is ~3x10<sup>8</sup> meters per second.  As a result, <i>c<sup>2</sup>&Delta;t<sup>2</sup></i>\n                        absolutely dominates the distance equation; <i>&Delta;x<sup>2</sup></i> is negligible in comparison.\n                        This incongruence gives rise to what appears to be a Galilean relationship between velocities.\n                        However, we can use <i>light-seconds</i> for the units on our x axis.  A light-second is the\n                        distance light travels in a single second.  Since we are using the speed of light as our conversion\n                        factor <i>c</i>, by definition, measuring our distance in light-seconds gives us a conversion factor\n                        <i>c</i> of 1 light-second per second:\n                    </p>\n                    <SpacetimeDiagram id=\"pythagorean_spacetime\" maxSpeed={3.14} step={.001} axisTicksX={10} showLightRays={false} transform={(theta, c) => {\n                        return [\n                            [cos(theta)/c, -sin(theta)],\n                            [sin(theta),  cos(theta)]\n                        ]\n                    }} translateVelocity={(v_frame, v_body, _) => v_body-v_frame} observers={[\n                        {\n                            name: \"Observer A\",\n                            relative_velocity: 0,\n                            proper_time: 0\n                        },\n                        {\n                            name: \"Observer B\",\n                            relative_velocity: .3,\n                            proper_time: 0\n                        },\n                        {\n                            name: \"Observer C\",\n                            relative_velocity: -.3,\n                            proper_time: 0\n                        }\n                    ]}/>\n\n                    <p>This is also representable as a system of equations (which, as promised, you are free to skip - just\n                    calling it a \"rotation\" is enough):</p>\n\n                    <Latex displayMode={true}>\n                        {\"$\\\\begin{matrix}\" +\n                            \"x' = cos(\\\\theta)x/c - sin(\\\\theta)t\\\\\\\\\" +\n                            \"t' = sin(\\\\theta)x + cos(\\\\theta)t\" +\n                        \"\\\\end{matrix}\" +\n                        \"\\\\:or\\\\:\" +\n                        \"\\\\begin{bmatrix}\" +\n                            \"cos(\\\\theta)/c & -sin(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\\" +\n                            \"sin(\\\\theta) & cos(\\\\theta)\" +\n                        \"\\\\end{bmatrix}$\"}\n                    </Latex>\n                </Collapsible>\n                <h2>A Rip in the Fabric</h2>\n\n                <p>\n                    Spoiler - neither the Galilean model nor our custom \"Pythagorean\" model correspond to real\n                    spacetime.  But scientists in the 19th century didn't know that, and they also didn't have animated\n                    diagrams of alternate spacetime structures.  So they can be forgiven for not having that on their\n                    radar when they started seeing some quite anomalous things.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Several experiments had begun to show that certain things appeared to change about the world based\n                    on a person's velocity.  The most well-known of these was that light appeared to have a constant\n                    speed - this speed did <i>not</i> appear to vary with the speed of the emitting body.  It was\n                    proposed by some that this could be the result of some invisible, all-permeating substance called\n                    the <b>luminiferous aether</b> - but if this were the case, we would at least expect to measure some\n                    variation in our measurement of the speed of light, based on the relative velocity of the measurement\n                    apparatus to the aether itself.  No such variation could be recorded.

This appeared not to be the case.  No satisfactory\n                    explanation could be given until Einstein published his paper on special relativity, which was not\n                    based on any experiments.
