With the benefit of hindsight, then, it seems\n                    that our approach to relativity should emphasize this fundamental symmetry, and that we should\n                    motivate our investigation in those terms.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    You're probably most familiar with symmetry in the realm of shapes, so we'll start there.  Take the\n                    example of an equilateral triangle.  We imagine that we are standing at one of its points; for\n                    brevity, we will call the point we are standing on <i>A</i>.  The point clockwise to us is <i>B</i>,\n                    and the point counter-clockwise to us is <i>C</i>.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Now, suppose that as you are contemplating the situation, I club you in the head, knocking you\n                    unconscious.  You wake up some time later and see that you are still on <i>some</i> point of the\n                    triangle. Ignoring the effects of any potential concussion, can you identify, just from looking at the\n                    triangle, which point you're standing on?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Assuming an ideal equilateral triangle, the answer is clearly no.  All the points look identical\n                    from the perspective of a person standing on any one of them - they would all describe the triangle\n                    the exact same way.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    This reveals the property that we call <b>symmetry</b>: informally, we will say it is the property\n                    that an object is identical from multiple perspectives.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Suppose now that I take you out to lunch as an apology.  During our meal, we notice a mysterious line\n                    drawn along the ground.  After sufficient assurance on my part that this isn't some kind of trick,\n                    we approach the line and investigate.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The line appears to go on forever in all directions.  We conclude that this line also has a sort of\n                    symmetry: we can follow the line in either direction, as far as we want, and the line will appear\n                    the same.  So we set down our things and follow the line as far as we can, for miles and miles,\n                    until finally, we come upon the place where we started.  That we recognize this point means we must\n                    have been wrong about the symmetry this object possesses.  While it's true that every point along\n                    our journey has been identical, we know that we are seeing a<i>different kind</i> of symmetry.\n                    It appears that what we thought was a line was actually just a very large circle, and that the\n                    symmetry we were observing wasn't the <i>translational</i> symmetry of a line, but the\n                    <i>rotational</i> symmetry of a circle.  But the limits of our perspective stopped us from seeing\n                    this fact.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Our universe, too, appears to be symmetric in many ways.  Taking the laws of physics together as a\n                    \"description\" of the universe, there are many ways in which a person can shift their perspective\n                    while that description remains valid.  For instance, I can carry out some closed experiment in America,\n                    and expect to get the same results in Spain - assuming nothing about the experiment has changed\n                    except the location.  So the universe, like the line, appears to exhibit\n                    <i>translational</i> symmetry.  Similarly, I can carry out an experiment, then face some other\n                    direction and carry it out again, and still expect the same results.  So the universe appears to\n                    exhibit <i>rotational</i> symmetry. I can wait an hour and do the experiment <i>again</i> and still\n                    expect the same result - so the universe exhibits symmetry across <i>time</i>.  And finally - most\n                    relevantly for us - I can carry out an experiment at some constant speed, and then carry it out at\n                    <i>another</i> constant speed, and still get the same results.  The universe thus appears to exhibit\n                    symmetry across changes in velocity.  In all these cases, my description of the universe\n                    <i>itself</i> - the laws of physics that govern my experiment - remains identical, although I might\n                    have different thoughts about what other objects <i>in</i> the universe are doing relative to\n                    <i>me</i>.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    However, we might ask ourselves what limitations the smallness of our perspective might be placing\n                    on our understanding of the nature of these symmetries.  This is the question we will reckon with\n                    here.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    We will continue to be very preoccupied with the symmetries of space and time, so I will leave the\n                    subject alone for now.  In the meantime, let's fix our gaze on the objects which supposedly exhibit\n                    all this symmetry: space and time themselves.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3>Symmetry: A Mathematical treatment</h3>\n\n                <h2>Space and Time</h2>\n\n                <p>We will be using <b>spacetime diagrams</b> to visualize each step in our journey through Special\n                Relativity, so before we go any farther we should figure out how to use them.</p>\n\n                <p>A spacetime diagram is a sort of graph consisting of at least two axes: one for time, and at least one\n                for space.

We have an axis for time which is totally\n                separate from our axis in space.  An object \"moves\" when its position in space changes based on its\n                position in time.  Furthermore, all objects experience time at the same \"rate\" - that is, a second is a\n                second is a second, no matter what velocity you're going.

For instance, plotting space and time together calls into\n                question: just what is the stuff in the middle?  What is it that objects are \"traversing\" as time\n                passes?  And if we consider it as just one object, are distances in space and distances in time\n                unrelated?  These are the questions we will answer when we begin to discuss the geometry underlying the\n                universe itself - <b>spacetime</b>.</p>\n\n                <p>But let's not get too ahead of ourselves.  Now that we know what we'll be looking at, let's dive in\n                and see what the relativity scene looks like pre-Einstein.</p>\n\n                <h2>Galilean Relativity</h2>\n\n                <p>Although the word \"relativity\" is closely associated with Einstein's work, the concept predates him\n                by centuries.  Before Einstein, the word was most closely related to <b>Galileo's principle of\n                relativity</b>, which states that the laws of physics should apply equally regardless of <b>inertial\n                reference frame</b>. In other words, a person cruising along in a spaceship moving at a constant speed\n                follows the same physical laws as a stationary person.  Indeed, it should not be necessary, <i>nor even\n                possible</i>, for either of them to know which of them is moving.  Hence, Galileo asserts the existence\n                of a universal <i>symmetry</i> - the symmetry over velocity.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This sounds like a very simple principle, but it poses a couple of challenges for anyone tasked with\n                    transcribing the physical laws of the universe, which must be solved in order.  The more obvious\n                    is the <i>second</i> question: how do we write the laws in such a way that that they are\n                    <b>invariant</b> over the given symmetry - meaning observers in two symmetric perspectives wouldn't\n                    see a difference in the laws?  If our laws are to accurately describe the universe, they must be\n                    symmetric in exactly the same way the universe is.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    However, this is only relevant after a first question is answered - a much more subtle question with a\n                    seemingly intuitive answer.  That question is: <i>what kind of symmetry are we dealing with?</i>\n                    After all, if your laws are supposed to be invariant under some symmetry, you had better know what\n                    that symmetry is.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    In concrete terms, take a person, Alice, who is riding a train.  Ahead of her, through the window,\n                    she sees Bob by the tracks.  He is standing still on the ground, but relative to Alice, he is moving\n                    towards her at -9 meters per second. Alice throws an apple at 12 meters per second, relative to her,\n                    towards Bob's head.  Assuming that all motion is happening in the same direction, how do we know how\n                    quickly the apple will hit Bob's head?

It\n                therefore more closely corresponds to the structure of space itself rather than the laws that govern\n                its contents.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3>Spacetime Intervals: an Early Introduction</h3>\n                <p>\n                When we look at the equations representing Galilean Transformations, we might be tempted to ask why\n                that <i>particular</i> transformation makes so much intuitive sense to us, and what we might find if we\n                adopted a different framework.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    There is one critical feature of the Galilean model that makes it a natural choice: it holds the\n                    flow of time constant for all bodies, regardless of their velocity through space.  It's worth noting\n                    that this by no means needs to be the case.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Recall that our spacetime diagram portrays an object's motion through space over time - or,\n                    considered together, <b>spacetime</b>.  In our model, all objects flow through time at the same\n                    rate.  This is actually kind of an interesting property.  Our velocity through all spatial\n                    dimensions can be changed, but we have one, immutable velocity through time.\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram showFrameSelector={false} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={10} spaceUnits=\"meters\" c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Moving Body\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                Notice that no matter how you adjust the object's relative speed, the dots on its line - its flow of\n                time - are equally spread along our graph's time axis.  Further, they always move at the same rate\n                with respect to the time axis.  This makes intuitive sense - it preserves a universal flow of time.  But\n                if we think of our diagram in terms of the stuff in the middle - <b>spacetime</b> - and think of\n                the distance the dots are travelling through it, we notice a strange property.  For very fast bodies,\n                the \"dots\" appear to move very quickly along the line - that is, they appear to <i>speed up</i> through\n                spacetime.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                And yet, when we switch into that object's frame of reference, its dots are spread out only by the\n                length of one second along the time axis, while it is the dots along our initial axis that are spread\n                out.\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram paused={false} showControls={false} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={10} spaceUnits=\"meters\" c={Infinity} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Initial Reference Frame\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Fast Body\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 10\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                Despite the apparent difference in distance between dots, each body thus appears to experience their\n                movement in the exact same way.  The difference in distance thus does not appear to be <i>real</i>;\n                the perceived difference arises only from our <i>perspective</i>. To reflect this, we can develop a\n                notion of <i>distance</i> in our spacetime that is <b>invariant</b> to our perspective - i.e. it is\n                defined in such a way that all dots, for all observers, are separated by the same distance.\n\n                We will call this notion of distance the <b>spacetime interval</b>.  The spacetime interval between two\n                points in spacetime will be the amount of time a body travelling between them would experience\n                during its journey.\n\n                Since the dots line up along the time axis no matter what, their distance can be given very simply:\n                where <i>&Delta;s</i> represents the distance between two points in <b>spacetime</b> and <i>&Delta;t</i>\n                represents their distance along the time axis, <i>&Delta;s = &Delta;t</i>.  How bizarre!  Distances in <i>spacetime</i> appear to be totally\n                independent of distance in <i>space</i>!\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                As a little thought experiment, let's think about what would happen if this <i>weren't</i> the case.\n                What if distance through <i>spacetime</i> worked the same way as distance through <i>space</i> - which,\n                as you may recall, is expressed by the <b>Pythagorean theorem</b>:\n                </p>\n\n                <Latex displayMode={true}>{'$\\\\Delta s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^2+\\\\Delta y^2+\\\\Delta z^2}$'}</Latex>\n\n                <p>\n                    To describe distance through space<i>time</i>, we could easily slip time into this equation:\n                </p>\n\n                <Latex displayMode={true}>{'$\\\\Delta s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^2+\\\\Delta y^2+\\\\Delta z^2+c^2\\\\Delta t^2}$'}</Latex>\n                <Latex>\n                    Where $$c$$ is an arbitrary constant for converting between units of time and units of space.

It will look a lot like our other ones, only the\n                    dots along each line will no longer be redundant: they will reflect <i>distance</i> through\n                    spacetime along the lines, which the moving body will experience as a second.\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram id=\"pythagorean_spacetime\" c={3e8} maxSpeed={5} spaceUnits={\"meters\"} axisTicksX={10} showLightRays={false} transform={(velocity, c) => {\n                    let theta = velocity*atan(1/c);\n                    return [\n                        [cos(theta)/c, -sin(theta)],\n                        [sin(theta),  cos(theta)]\n                    ]\n                }} translateVelocity={(v_frame, v_body, _) => v_body-v_frame} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer A\",\n                        relative_velocity: 0,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer B\",\n                        relative_velocity: 2,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer C\",\n                        relative_velocity: -2,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>\n                    Voila!  We have now decoupled ourselves from Galilean transformations, and are free to explore\n                    any spacetime we please!  Like this one!  This exotic spacetime geometry works by... well...\n                    actually, it doesn't seem to work all that differently, does it?  Why are our dots still so evenly\n                    spaced out along the time axis?  Shouldn't it be the length along the <i>line</i> which is\n                    constant?  Take a minute and try to think about why this might be.  If you need a place to start,\n                    try to work out the distances between some pairs of dots using our distance equation.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Have you tried it yet?  If you tried working out the distance between two points,\n                    you may have noticed that you're missing a very important part of the equation: <i>c</i>, the\n                    conversion factor between meters and seconds!  I left this parameter at its real-world value, which\n                    is ~3x10<sup>8</sup> meters per second.  As a result, <i>c<sup>2</sup>&Delta;t<sup>2</sup></i>\n                    absolutely dominates the distance equation; <i>&Delta;x<sup>2</sup></i> is negligible in comparison.\n                    This incongruence gives rise to what appears to be a Galilean relationship between velocities.\n                    However, we can use <i>light-seconds</i> for the units on our x axis.  A light-second is the\n                    distance light travels in a single second.  Since we are using the speed of light as our conversion\n                    factor <i>c</i>, by definition, measuring our distance in light-seconds gives us a conversion factor\n                    <i>c</i> of 1 light-second per second:\n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram allowPausing={false} id=\"pythagorean_spacetime\" maxSpeed={3.14} step={.001} axisTicksX={10} showLightRays={false} transform={(theta, c) => {\n                    return [\n                        [cos(theta)/c, -sin(theta)],\n                        [sin(theta),  cos(theta)]\n                    ]\n                }} translateVelocity={(v_frame, v_body, _) => v_body-v_frame} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer A\",\n                        relative_velocity: 0,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer B\",\n                        relative_velocity: .3,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer C\",\n                        relative_velocity: -.3,\n                        proper_time: 0\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n\n                <p>Now <i>there's</i> something interesting!

For\n                    instance, because the dots are no longer evenly spaced along our reference frame's time axis,\n                    it appears to pass at different rates for different objects.  In our case, the dots appear closer\n                    together and thus <i>contracted</i>; their real-life counterparts appear <i>dilated</i> for very\n                    similar reasons.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Notice that if you crank the velocity, the line disappears below the x axis and pops up\n                on the other side!  This is the <i>flip-side</i> of the line; it represents the object's past. By doing\n                this, we have reversed the object's orientation along our time axis.  In other words, the object is\n                travelling backwards in time!</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This is a neat little property, but don't get too excited.  We've called an axis on our graph\n                    \"time\", but what's <b>time-like</b> about it, really?  It doesn't flow in a uniform direction.\n                    It's not related to the spatial dimensions in a special way: in fact, it's explicitly defined\n                    so that it fits in exactly with the other spatial dimensions.  An object in this universe could\n                    double back on itself and intersect with its own past - clearly a nonsensical property.  But this\n                    is nonetheless a good thought experiment with which to introduce <b>spacetime</b> and <b>spacetime\n                    intervals</b>.  We will see shortly that our own spacetime has its own exotic properties which,\n                    luckily for us, nonetheless preserve the causal structure of time.\n                </p>\n\n                <h2>A Rip in the Fabric</h2>\n\n                <p>\n                    Spoiler - neither the Galilean model nor our custom \"Pythagorean\" model correspond to real\n                    spacetime.  But scientists in the 19th century didn't know that, and they also didn't have animated\n                    diagrams of alternate spacetime structures.  So they can be forgiven for not having that on their\n                    radar when they started seeing some quite anomalous things.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Several experiments had begun to show that certain things appeared to change about the world based\n                    on a person's velocity.  The most well-known of these was that light appeared to have a constant\n                    speed - this speed did <i>not</i> appear to vary with the speed of the emitting body.  It was\n                    proposed by some that this could be the result of some invisible, all-permeating substance called\n                    the <b>luminiferous aether</b> - but if this were the case, we would at least expect to measure some\n                    variation in our measurement of the speed of light, based on the relative velocity of the measurement\n                    apparatus to the aether itself.  No such variation could be recorded.  The speed of light did not\n                    obey the Galilean transformations.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    This was a very bad sign; Galileo's principle of relativity holds that the laws of physics should be\n                    <i>invariant</i> under changes in inertial frame.  This appeared not to be the case.  No satisfactory\n                    explanation could be given until Einstein published his paper on special relativity, which was not\n                    based on any experiments.  It started only with two assumptions, and deduced the entire theory\n                    from these: that the laws of physics are invariant under changes in inertial reference frame,\n                    <i>and</i> the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    \n                </p>\n\n                <SpacetimeDiagram paused={false} showLightRays={false} maxSpeed={10} spaceUnits=\"meters\" c={3e8} observers={[\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer A\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer B\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: 5\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: \"Observer C\",\n                        proper_time: 0,\n                        relative_velocity: -1\n                    }\n                ]}/>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
